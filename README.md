## License and Attribution

This project was something I did for an internship, so other than using the Logo image of the company and its name you can tweak the theme and components to use everything else.

## Built With

- React.js
- ASP.NET C#
- SQL/XML/OLEDB

## Pre Recorded Demo

- Click [here](https://hotel-landin-page-rosy.vercel.app/) to view the live demo.

## Getting Started

To get started with this, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

Node.js 
Visual studio
Visual studio code
Git
Microsoft SQL server management studio or SQL database connection string

### Setup

- With git, clone the code to your machine, or download a ZIP of all the files directly.
- [Download the ZIP file from this location](https://github.com/amiladimantha/Leave-Managment-System/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) or run the following [git](https://git-scm.com/) command to clone the files to your machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/amiladimantha/Leave-Managment-System.git
```
### Frontend

- Once the files are on your machine, open the **leave-management-system** folder
- Next open the **frontend-tst** folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

```
cd leave-management-system
cd frontend-tst && code .
```

### Backend

- Once the files are on your machine, open the **leave-management-system** folder
- Next open the **usermg-backend** folder and run the **LMS.sln** using [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&channel=Release&version=VS2022&source=VSLandingPage&cid=2030&passive=false).
- This will start the backend server

### Database

You can configure the database string using appsettings.json file in **usermg-backend** >> **LMS** >> **appsettings.json** => modify this : "Server=[your device sql server name];Database=usermg;Trusted_Connection=True;" replace the server name of your devices sql server.
The database name given by me in connection string is "usermg"


The SQL commands to create the database tables.

# ******************************
create database usermg;

use usermg;

create table Registration(
ID int identity(1,1) primary key,
Name varchar(100),
Email varchar(100),
Password varchar(100),
Phone varchar(100),
IsActive int,
IsApproved int,
AccountType int,
Birthday Datetime,
Address varchar(500),
Image varchar(100)
);

create table Leaves(
ID int identity(1,1) primary key,
CreatorID int,
CreatorName varchar(100),
FromDate Datetime,
ToDate Datetime,
NoofDays int,
LeaveType int,
IsApproved int,
FOREIGN KEY (CreatorID) REFERENCES Registration(ID)
);


create table ExtraLeaves(
ID int identity(1,1) primary key,
CreatorID int,
CreatorName varchar(100),
FromDate Datetime,
ToDate Datetime,
NoofDays int,
Reason varchar(1000),
IsApproved int,
FOREIGN KEY (CreatorID) REFERENCES Registration(ID)
);

# ******************************
create an admin account from here, 

insert into registration (name,email,password,phone,isactive,isapproved,accounttype,birthday,address) 
values ('admin','admin@gmail.com','nyKq4FXckfUq3AyecAFYqw==', '7975777666', 1,1,0,'1989-01-09 13:30:28.620','London, UK') 

Admin email : admin@gmail.com
Password : Admin123   after encryption => nyKq4FXckfUq3AyecAFYqw==

or register an account from ui and set the accounttype as 0 using an sql query, this will make that account as the admin

#*******************************
